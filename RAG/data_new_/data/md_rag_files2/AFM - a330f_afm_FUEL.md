# FUEL IMBALANCE
Ident.: ABN-28-00005132.0001001 / 26 NOV 09
APPROVED
Criteria: A330
Compare FOB + FU with the FOB at departure.
If the difference is significant, or if FOB + FU decreases, suspect a fuel leak.
CAUTION
Do not apply this procedure if a leak is suspected. Refer to ABN-28 FUEL LEAK.
Open wing crossfeed valve.
If wing crossfeed valve open:
Turn off all wing pumps (standby then normal) on the lighter side.
When fuel balanced:
Turn on all wing pumps (normal then standby).
Close wing crossfeed valve.
If wing crossfeed valve failed closed:
Manually perform a fuel transfer from the outer tanks.
Fly with a blank angle of 3 ° wing down on the lighter side and use rudder trim to get constant
course and neutral stick.
# FUEL GRAVITY FEEDING
Ident.: ABN-28-00005133.0002001 / 16 APR 10
APPROVED
Criteria: (330-243 or 330-243F)
Descend to gravity feed ceiling (if applicable).
Flight conditions at the time of gravity feeding
Gravity feed ceiling
FUEL DEAERATED
(Flight time from takeoff greater than 30 min)
20 000 ft
FUEL NON DEAERATED
(Flight time from takeoff lower than 30 min)
15 000 ft (*)
(*) 7 000 ft if JP4, JET B is used
When reaching gravity feed ceiling:
Close wing crossfeed valve.
Set ENG START selector to IGN START.
Avoid negative g load factor.

# FUEL LEAK
Ident.: ABN-28-00005134.0004001 / 28 FEB 11
APPROVED
Criteria: (330-200F and 58623)
A fuel leak may be detected if:
‐ The sum of the FOB and the FU is significantly less than the FOB at engine start, or decreases,
or
‐ An occupant observes fuel spray from engine/pylon or wing tip, or
‐ The total fuel quantity decreases at an abnormal rate, or
‐ A fuel imbalance develops, or
‐ The fuel quantity of a tank decreases too fast (leak from engine/pylon or a hole in a tank), or
‐ A tank overflows (due to a pipe rupture in a tank), or
‐ Fuel flow is excessive (leak from engine), or
‐ Fuel is smelt in the courier area or main deck cargo compartment.
If possible and if visibility permits, a visual check from the main deck cargo compartment may
enable identification of the leak source.
When a leak is confirmed:
LAND ASAP
If leak from engine/pylon confirmed:
Shut down affected engine.
Note:
If the leak stops, the wing crossfeed valve can now be selected open to
re-balance the fuel quantity or to enable use of fuel from both wings. Do not
restart the engine.
If leak from engine/pylon not confirmed or leak not located:
Keep wing crossfeed valve closed.
CAI
Do not open the wing crossfeed valve, even if requested by another ECAM
procedure.
Set trim tank feed to ISOL.
Monitor inner tank fuel quantities and look for one tank depleting faster.
If one inner tank depletes faster than the other by at least 500 kg (1 102 lb) in less
than 30 min:
Shut down affected engine and monitor the fuel leak.
If the leak stops:
Set trim tank feed to AUTO.

Note:
The wing crossfeed valve can now be selected open to re-balance the
fuel quantity, or to enable use of fuel from both wings. Do not restart the
engine.
If the leak continues after engine shutdown:
Suspect leak from wing.
Consider restarting the engine and applying the fuel loss reduction procedure.
Refer to ABN-28 FUEL LOSS REDUCTION PROCEDURE.
Note:
The wing crossfeed valve can be selected open.
If both inner tanks deplete at a similar rate:
Note:
The wing crossfeed valve can be selected open.
If fuel smell in the courier area or in the main deck cargo compartment:
Shut down APU if running.
Keep trim tank feed at ISOL.
If no fuel smell in the courier area or in the main deck cargo compartment:
Consider applying the fuel loss reduction procedure. Refer to ABN-28 FUEL LOSS
REDUCTION PROCEDURE.
For landing:
CAUTION
Do not use reverse

APPROVED
Criteria: (330-300 or (330-200F and 58623))
When required by the fuel leak procedure and if trim tank not empty:
Set trim tank feed to AUTO.
Set trim tank mode to FWD.
When the trim tank is empty:
Set trim tank mode back to AUTO.
Set trim tank feed back to ISOL.
